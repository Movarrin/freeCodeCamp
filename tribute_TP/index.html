                    <p class="text-center text-warning">Sir Terry Pratchett was born in 1948 and left all too early in 2015. Sadly his passing was hastened by early onset Alzheimer's.</p>
                    <!-- second paragraph -->
                    <p class="text-center text-warning">Sir Terry was knighted in 2009.</p>
                    <!-- third paragraph -->
                    <p class="text-center text-warning">He was a very prolific author most well known for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld" target="blank">Discworld</a> series of books. First published at age thirteen he moved into a role at a newspaper. A chance comment while conducting an interview led him to publish his first book <span class="text-success">The Carpet People.</span></p>
                    <!-- fourth paragraph -->
                    <p class="text-center text-warning">His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld" target="blank">Discworld</a> series of books were far and away his most popular works. He lampooned religion, politics, pop culture, and classical literature and did so with a unique and touching wit.</p>
                    <p class="text-center text-warning">One of his most beloved characters was Death. Somehow he made this entity someone you root for, even love. Death had many great adventures but never cruel.</p>
                    <p class="text-center text-warning">Alas, eventually Death comes for us all.</p>
